# ArtiCull: Variant Call Refinement for scWGS

**ArtiCull** (<ins>Arti</ins>fact <ins>Cull</ins>er) is a variant call refinement algorithm for single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) data. It enables single nucleotide variant (SNV) based analyses in scWGS, including mutational signature and evolutionary analyses.

For details on running ArtiCull, please visit [https://articull.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://articull.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
